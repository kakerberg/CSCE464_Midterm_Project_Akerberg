# CSCE 464 Midterm Project
## Kevin Akerberg
## Spring 2024  

This project is a useable website to fulfill the requirements for CSCE 464's midterm project. It is a parody of the car buying website Cars & Bids launched by auto YouTuber and journalist Doug Demuro. This site will use that as a base to demonstrate frontend web development concepts covered in CSCE 464 up to this point.
